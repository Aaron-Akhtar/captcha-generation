# captcha-generation
This project is essentially a very basic implementation of Captcha generation in core java.

I made this with the hopes of it allowing new people to learn how these sorts of things are made and hopefully this will allow people to make some cool things for the community.


Things you should have in captcha systems that are used in realtime:
 - Better random generation such as random line generation etc (for the purpose of this I did not want to make it over complicated so I did not add this).
 - Captcha Sessions / Timeouts.
 etc
